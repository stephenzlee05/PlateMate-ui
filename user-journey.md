The user journey begins when a someone opens PlateMate and wants to try a new workout but isn't sure what to do. On his first visit, he creates a new user account through the User Management tab, entering his username and email address, which automatically generates default preferences for weight increments and units. Curious about available exercises, he browses the Exercise Catalog where he discovers various exercises organized by muscle groups, movement patterns, and equipment requirements, from bodyweight exercises he can do at home to gym equipment-based movements.

He decides to start his first workout session through the Workout Tracking tab, where he selects his user profile and clicks "Start New Session." He begins by adding exercises to his session, starting with push-ups (3 sets of 10 reps with bodyweight), followed by squats (3 sets of 12 reps), and finishes with planks (3 sets of 30 seconds). After completing his workout, he reviews the exercises he logged in the session and feels accomplished seeing his first workout recorded.

Later, he explores the Routine Planning tab where he creates his first workout template called "Beginner Full Body," selecting exercises that target different muscle groups to ensure balanced training. The system helps him understand which muscle groups he's targeting and suggests complementary exercises. By the end of the week, he has completed three workout sessions and decides to check his progression in the Progression Tracking tab, where he can see how his performance has evolved and get suggestions for weight increases or exercise modifications based on his recent performance.
